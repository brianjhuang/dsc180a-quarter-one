How many people actually HAVE been exposed and didn&#39;t develop anything that would make them run to a doctor in panic?  The real answer is, there is no number because no one is looking for it, and no one is reporting it.  How many people are being tested to see if they HAVE been exposed to it and already have the antibodies?  Apparently, unless it&#39;s happening and the media isn&#39;t saying anything about it, few to none.  No one is asking anything that question or doing those tests either.  So why are these issues being ignored while all that goes in the media are reports of people who supposedly tested positive for it?  Also, you know that the so-called &quot;reporting bodies&quot; don&#39;t actually report real numbers, right?  The medical &quot;protocol&quot; is that the vast majority of people are not positively tested for the virus after death.  Anyone who dies of a non-traumatic death during this &quot;pandemic&quot; is automagically added to the covid statistic.  This is the policy in all the 1st world western countries, NA and Europe.  Why is this the policy?  Why all the fear mongering on &quot;positive cases&quot;?  Why no antibody testing?  Why no testing of exposure with zero or mild side effects?  Too easy to shoot all of the fear mongering and inflated numbers out of the water?  You can theorize on why only fear-based number reporting is being used.',\n",

How many people actually HAVE been exposed and didn\\'t develop anything that would make them run to a doctor in panic?  The real answer is, there is no number because no one is looking for it, and no one is reporting it.  How many people are being tested to see if they HAVE been exposed to it and already have the antibodies?  Apparently, unless it\\'s happening and the media isn\\'t saying anything about it, few to none.  No one is asking anything that question or doing those tests either.  So why are these issues being ignored while all that goes in the media are reports of people who supposedly tested positive for it?  Also, you know that the so-called \"reporting bodies\" don\\'t actually report real numbers, right?  The medical \"protocol\" is that the vast majority of people are not positively tested for the virus after death.  Anyone who dies of a non-traumatic death during this \"pandemic\" is automagically added to the covid statistic.  This is the policy in all the 1st world western countries, NA and Europe.  Why is this the policy?  Why all the fear mongering on \"positive cases\"?  Why no antibody testing?  Why no testing of exposure with zero or mild side effects?  Too easy to shoot all of the fear mongering and inflated numbers out of the water?  You can theorize on why only fear-based number reporting is being used.',\n",
